# Document Information Extraction using OCR and LLMs

Our project aimed to develop a flexible and efficient solution for extracting information from a variety of document formats. By leveraging **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as **Llama 3**, we explored how advanced contextual capabilities of LLMs could enhance the accuracy and adaptability of information extraction.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Document Support**: Our approach is adaptable to numerous document types (pdf,png,jpg,docs), whether they are scanned images, PDFs, or other formats, without requiring specific pre-training or rule-based configurations for each type.
  
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) (PaddleOCR)**: Extracts textual data from scanned documents or images, transforming it into machine-readable content.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Utilizes advanced language models to interpret and analyze the extracted text, offering contextual understanding for better information extraction.

## Innovation

- The innovation of this method lies in its **adaptability**. Unlike traditional systems that require extensive rule-based settings or format-specific training, our solution can process various document formats with minimal configuration.
- Also **Privacy** in Our approach we used Local LLMs so there no the third party.
